# GoPkmSaveReader
![tests_status](https://github.com/PailosNicolas/GoPkmSaveReader/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)\
This is a Pokemon save reader, it's far from complete and currently only supports Gen III. The goal is to be able to get
all the save information, export pokemons for backup purposes and import them into saves. Depending on progress thinking
about trades and trade evolution wouldn't be far fetched.
